# Excerpts from the Journal of Garrick, Enlightened Vowkeeper

## Book 4 - Page 124

The summons was abrupt, but that is not unusual for Master Ferec. I learned long ago that the best way to deal with his impetuous decision making style was to always be prepared. Ferec had sent an initiate to find me. Perhaps I am just getting older, but this young man looked barely older than a child. As he spoke, I heard a crack in his voice. Looking into his eyes, I know the experiences of the last several months have aged him more than his body will show. My days as an initiate were hard enough and the thought of experiencing the fracture during that time is unimaginable.

I quickly gathered my most recent notes and followed the initiate towards the upper keep. Although my standing meant I could also reside in the keep, I preferred the quiet and privacy of my terrace home. I knew that Ardin was reluctant to allow the Vowkeepers to occupy such a visible location. The whispers had started almost immediately; had Ardin lost his powers as warden? I was not surprised, Ferec can be very convincing.

To my surprise upon entering the upper hall I was met by both Master Ferec Snowlash and Warden Ardin Wynro. They could not be more opposite in appearance and seeing them side by side felt almost comical. Both a bit past middle age, Ferec was slightly balding and clearly enjoyed too many shombi nut pies. It would be easy to dismiss Ferec as feeble if not for the glacial blue eyes that projected immense intelligence. Ardin had only a few flecks of grey in his black hair, strongly built from years of physical training and a clear rigidity gained from his military service. They had been in a deep discussion and both turned to me as I entered.

I was prepared for a discussion on the state of the refugees or to get a new directive to pick up my previous work cataloging historical artifacts. What I was not expecting was a flurry of questions about the Breakers. Somewhat foolishly, I had expected the focus of the Warden and current ranking member of the Vowkeepers to be on the suffering refugees of the Highlands. Instead they wanted to know any information I had on the Breakers. They wanted to know how they were getting to the Hollow Lands, what they were looking for, how they were surviving the spellstorm, and more.

Unfortunately, in all my previous research, I found little recorded on the Breakers. What little I do know beyond the power of the gauntlets and runestones relates to Vital Stones. The use of a Vital Stone is central to the breaking of the vow. I have no idea if or how these Breakers found Vital Stones or even if they use them. All I know is what was in my research.

Judging by the looks I received from Ferec and Ardin, I do not think my answers were satisfying.

My gut response of being defensive is concerning on later reflection. Am I starting to empathize with the Breakers? I know the corruption that has befallen them. I know my own curiosity on their nature and their power. But am I willing to stand by and let them continue their illegal ways? Am I going to stand up for them? Defend them? Or worse...

This morning I found something rather strange in a manifest of Brilstones. There were two listed at the end marked as Vital Stones. These were worth orders of magnitude more than the other gems listed. Old teachings of the Vowkeepers speak of Elan Stones as being a source of corrupting magic in the same way as the Brilstones placed in gauntlets. I suspect that these Vital Stones are in fact Elan Stones.

I had not thought much about Elan Stones since my days as a student. Some part of me thought they did not even exist. Runechips are common enough and many Brilstone gauntlets still exist, but I have never seen an Elan Stone.

Elan Stones were considered the highest of treason and they were also the most mysterious. Vowkeeper initiates were simply taught that using an Elan Stone was the ultimate corruption, but were given no insight into how they worked. The texts I could find spoke of these stones granting eternal life. The information in my notes was confusing, listing that a user could still die but would return in time. One account listed a fallen mage that was able to stay in a form of stasis and the power of another was able to revive him.

I wish there was more information here, but it is just a line in a ledger. There must be more information on these Vital or Elan stones somewhere.

I had never ventured to the outer fringe of Longwatch before. On my morning walk, I saw the message from the Breakers and knew they wanted to meet. The lower bailey was on the easternmost edge of town far from the refugee encampments. It was a well kept secret because it was only accessible through some winding back alleys. Few people came here as this area was patrolled by Breakers at all hours. It has become a stronghold of sorts but to the annoyance of the Keepers the local Vowguard was too busy to crack down here. There was no crime reported in the area but almost everyone knew the sorts of crimes being committed.

I left around dusk and veered into one of the side alleys, my mind wandering on about what the Breakers could have found. In recent days they were making more frequent trips to the Hollow Lands. Either they are getting much better at timing the spellstorms or perhaps the worst storms have subsided. I know long ago the men of the Highlands would predict the spelltides and be able to seek shelter. The ruins of many aegis spires still dot the countryside, although they have not been activated in generations.

Word had spread that the fragile pass connecting Longwatch to the Hollow Lands was starting to splinter. Luckily it seemed that the stream of refugees had all but stopped at this point. It still saddens me that so few managed to make the journey. But that meant that the Breakers must have found another way to access the Hollow Lands. I had thought on this idly for quite some time and did not expect to find out the truth of this tonight.

Making the final turn before the outer courtyard I was met by a group of Breakers. Some of them looked familiar. In all my interactions with them up until now I had never bothered to ask any of their names. I feel a bit ashamed about that, but I know that I know my dealings here were already questionable enough. One of the Breakers held up a gloved hand and I stopped. Several heartbeats passed as I waited and watched. A whistle came from inside the courtyard and the Breakers moved aside and ushered me in.

The courtyard itself had been turned into a small tent city. It was shockingly well organized with a handful of young people buzzing in and out carrying various objects almost all wrapped in cloth. I entered a tent near the center and my escorts peeled off to return to their posts. Upon entering a young woman pushed her way around a massive table covered in scrolls and a very large marp. She introduced herself as Avira Emberdane and she was the leader of this small group of Breakers. I realized that this was the same young woman that had brought me that incredible amulet many days before.

This time she did not have a magic amulet, a runestone or even a Brilstone gauntlet to show me. Instead she had a single letter. She told me this letter is proof that the fracture itself was not some catastrophic accident but instead was caused by the Vowkeepers themselves. She held the letter up to me and said this was the first bit of proof. She wanted my help to uncover the rest. I took the letter and took my leave for the night, telling her I needed to think on her request.

I walked quickly back home as if the letter I carried was some beacon of corruption. Upon entering my bedroom I pulled the letter out, stomped the floorboard that contained my hidebox and slipped the letter in quickly. I was not ready to read the letter just yet. In my haste to take the letter from Avira I was able to catch just one thing: the letter was addressed to Ferec Snowlash.
