# Excerpts from the Journal of Garrick, Enlightened Vowkeeper

## Book 2 - Page 489

This morning I discovered something wondrous within a seemingly forgotten old merchant chest: a runestone. These old relics allow their caster to focus and channel runic magic. This is not the first time I have seen a rune object. While runic magic is outlawed under the Vowkeeper doctrine, it is still common to see runechips. These days I have only seen runechips used for fun tricks during name day celebrations.

My curiosity got the best of me and I must confess I had to know if it would still activate. Before I knew it I dashed from one end of the vault to the other in an instant. The runestone works! I feel guilty admitting my exhilaration.

I have spent many hours contemplating why many of the ancient texts do not mention runes at all. Many in the order believe the omission is purely accidental. I am not convinced. I believe runic magic is different from the elemental magic I have studied. I think it may even have a different origin altogether.

The chest also held seemingly innocuous letters and a ledger. This ledger is very old but details trade routes from Halcyon to Vidallah. It has been over a century since there was free flowing trade running through Brightswell Tower. Much of the business detailed in the ledger is around runestones. It makes mention of several I have never heard of before.

While the discovery of new runestones is exciting there is more to study in the ledger. Since the border closing we have heard very little from the Prisma. From my readings they were once great allies of ours, and from the looks of this ledger, great trade partners as well. It seems that they had access to runes but hungered for brilstones and opalesce ore in great quantities.

Furthering this research will keep me occupied for the next several days and I am already falling behind with each new vault I visit. I need to be careful about my focus because I tend to lose track of time. I really donâ€™t want to miss another dinner invitation with Hope.
