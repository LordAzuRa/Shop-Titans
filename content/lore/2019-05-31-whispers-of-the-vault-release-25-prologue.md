# Excerpts from the Journal of Garrick, Enlightened Vowkeeper

## Book 4 - Page 110

I woke this morning to a message. With order restored in Longwatch, more attention is being diverted to the Breakers. I need to be more careful about my meetings with them. I have instructed them to leave a mark by the Ribbonwood trees I pass on my morning walk if they return from the Hollow Lands with something of interest. While I empathize with their excitement, I must guide them to be more subtle next time.



I met a single Breaker outside the southern refugee encampment. The number of survivors entering Longwatch has slowed to a trickle but the camps are still overflowing. Ardin has done impressive work managing these efforts without descending into utter chaos. I worry for him now that he must deal with the politics of the Vowkeepers and Vowguard all wrapped into a single city. And that without mentioning the challenge the Breakers will present to him…

I could tell from my first glance it was an old relic. The style was clearly not from the native masterworkers of Dustpool. The Brilstone was cut with incredible precision and adorned with intricate scrollwork. Truly magnificent craftsmanship that glittered in the morning sunshine.

Holding this treasure brought memories flowing back. Its weight reminded me of traveling the Gildway as an apprentice learning accounting and trade. The power I felt emanating from the Brilstone made the hair on my neck stand up, just as it did the first time I discovered the ancient gauntlets of my grandfather. The feelings and memories were wondrous, enchanting, and dangerous all at the same time.

The Breaker wanted me to identify the necklace. She was quite disappointed when I explained that I could not. The only way to understand the power of that Brilstone was to wear it. The Vowkeeper doctrine does not forbid me from wearing such powerful artifacts, but I worry about the temptations that it would bring.

I heard rumors that there was still an armorer hiding somewhere in Longwatch. He may be the only person with the knowledge to identify such a relic. His kind has long been missing from the Highlands, even well before the fracture. While travel is not truly outlawed, the Vowguard is incredibly suspicious of outsiders. Edgewall Gate has been blockaded since I was a child, closing the entrance to the Red Stairs. The Gildway was still left open until Bron Odium took control of Dustpool Hold. His fear of outsiders outweighed his better judgement and his greed. Since those days I have seen very few armorers and even less of their wares.

When I pressed the Breaker on where she found the necklace, it was clear this is not the only treasure she uncovered. It appears that the fracture may have cracked open some previously hidden areas of Luxvault. I had heard rumors and found traces of rare items stored there many years ago. If my memory serves me well, most of that area was endowed to the Vowkeepers for use. That may mean this amulet—and whatever else this fortune seeker has found—once belonged to the order. That is both worrying and confusing and I must think on what it means.

I have nearly finished my work in the bowels of Dawnholm. If not for the summer evenings I have been spending in the fading sun with Hope, I am sure I would go mad. The amount of dust and well-aged grime I scrape from my boots each night is a constant reminder of how deep I delved. The last few weeks have been mired in boredom; ever since I found that working runestone, nothing else has seemed exciting.

Until today. This afternoon, upon moving a large old bookcase, I found what appeared to be a hidden door. The door itself is made of solid stone and I could find no clear locking mechanism. As luck would have it, through the passage of time, a chip has formed in one edge and I could peer through the crack. Through much hard work and some ingenuity with a broom I swiped from my quarters, I was able to pull a few loose papers through.

There is not much to go on from the scraps, but it appears to be a manifest of items. I cannot easily decipher what all the items are, but they appear to be incredibly valuable. The location is also not apparent but there was a foremark from a family that owns large portions of Luxvault. This needs more investigation and I must determine a way to open that door without Keeper Harmon—or anyone else—taking notice.
