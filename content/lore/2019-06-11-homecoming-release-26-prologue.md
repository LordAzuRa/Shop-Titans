# Excerpts from the Journal of Garrick, Enlightened Vowkeeper

## Book 4 - Page 49

The first caravans are leaving for Longwatch. We got confirmation they escaped the terrible fracture somehow. There is still a small pass connecting it to the Highlands. Word is that the quakes may force it to collapse, so the order is to move as quickly as possible and take only what we need. I can’t remember the last time I disobeyed a direct command, but I feel that I can’t leave without a stop back home. I must return to Westmar, to the house of my father. I only hope it still stands and that my father still lives.

The road will also lead me through Dawnholm. I have avoided news of the school there but the limited reports I have heard are grim. Many times I have made the journey to Longwatch but I cannot escape the feeling that this will be the most difficult trip of my life.

I knew he would not understand. He feels that the order is only for the children of peakborn tyrants. The very fact that he thinks my talents are wasted with the Vowkeepers makes me want to join them even more. He has always wished I would stay in Westmar and take over the merchant stall. Ever since my apprenticeship in Dustpool, he has dreamed I would become an accountant. I did not work for years in school to simply sell apples and yearicots all day. I want to study. I want to grow. I want to chronicle history. There is so much knowledge we do not yet know.

I leave tomorrow for Fort Halcyon to meet with the other acolytes. It has been four days since I have spoken with my father and I assumed we would not talk again before I left. When I woke this morning there was a note scrawled on a scrap of parchment along with a key. The note read, "You have much to learn even in Westmar." Picking up the key, I knew what it was for. This was the key to the chest that contained the belongings of my great-grandfather.

I don't remember anything of my great-grandfather. He died when I was very young. I know he trained in the Vowguard and had fought some long forgotten battles. My grandfather and father spoke very little of him growing up. Whenever he was mentioned, there would be deflection followed by knowing glances that I only noticed in the last few years. I never pushed for much information even though I desperately wanted it. The handful of letters I found from him that I stashed under my bed were quickly taken and put in his chest. There are few times I have seen my father so upset than when he found that I had discovered those letters.

The chest sits in the root cellar mostly hidden behind barrels. I have known it was there for years and apparently my father also knew that I discovered the chest as well. I went immediately to the cellar with the key. I had no idea what I would find in that chest but I can tell you my imagination was running wild!

The chest itself is not very big and despite the age the wood is incredibly strong and heavy. I think it is made from Coldwood, which would mean even the chest itself is valuable. Inside I found the letters I read several years ago and a journal. There was an honormark there as well signifying that this man was a hero. I sat for a moment wondering why my grandfather and father seemed so ashamed of even the memory of this man.

Then, I found out why. Near the bottom of the chest, wrapped in some scraps of cloth I felt something heavy and possibly metal. I leaped back when I realized it was warm to the touch, thinking there was a family of grainrats that had moved in. After prodding a few times I finally realized it was not a rodent and picked it up.

I hesitate to even document this but under that cloth was a magic gauntlet. Judging from the Brilstones it was a very powerful one and the heat radiating from it must mean it is fire in nature. After looking at the beauty of the design for what felt like hours, I quickly wrapped the gauntlet back up and carefully placed it in the chest. I moved the chest back as far as I could in the cellar and stood for a moment thinking what to do next. I stacked barrel after barrel in front of it in an attempt to get as much distance as possible from my family's past. For the rest of the day I have avoided my father entirely and I hid the key in my hidebox below a floorboard in my room.

Do I report this when I get to Fort Halcyon? The fact that this gauntlet exists and has not been turned over to the Vowguard is against the law and also heresy! Why did my father want me to know this now? Did he think this would make me not join the Vowkeepers knowing that my great-grandfather used magic?

I need sleep. Tomorrow starts a long trip to Fort Halcyon.

## Book 4 - Page 53

The state of Dawnholm prepared me for the worst. I must admit with relief that Westmar, while still quite devastated, was not as bad as I had expected. Many of the houses still stand. I could see from the edge of the village that the house of my father was still roughly intact. From the first sight my stomach tied in knots, and it was not due to missing many meals since the fracture.

I had left my caravan behind in Dawnholm and the eerie silence was stifling. It was clear the village was empty and there were no signs of life left. As I slowly walked towards my childhood house, I let the emotion flow over me. I wondered if I would find my father’s body somewhere within the walls before me.

The house itself still stood. Technically. Several walls had collapsed and the roof was mostly gone. I did a quick check of the premises to see if I could find any bodies and I saw nothing. I wonder if my father survived. He may have been on the caravans to Longwatch. Part of me expected to find him here. It has been decades since we have spoken and I assumed he would die before I spoke with him again. I now hope I get a chance to see him once more.

My room was almost as I left it. The roof had collapsed but it was all too familiar. Night was coming so I had to move quickly and brush aside any nostalgia for another day. I moved my bed with some effort and found the floorboard I was looking for. It took longer than I expected to pry open the floor and find the hidebox. It was still there, just as I remembered all those years ago. Holding it up, I shook it lightly and heard the satisfying rattle of the key I needed inside.

The cellar door was covered in debris. I quickly cleared it off and went inside. The fading light of the day was not much help and I stumbled down the stairs that I went down hundreds of times as a youth. Tossing barrels aside, I made my way to the chest. It was covered in dust. It had not been touched since I left all those years ago. The key was sticky, but it still worked. The Coldwood was still strong and rigid to the touch.

I was able to recover the letters and the journal. I could not leave the honormark behind. What I came for was at the bottom of the chest, wrapped in cloth. The gauntlet was still there. Still hidden. Still warm. Ornate. Beautiful. Massive Brilstones showing in it. I dared not put it on but I must admit I was tempted. If there was ever a time to break my vow, now feels like that time.

I placed it in my bag with the rest of my great-grandfather’s belongings and made my way out of the cellar. I only made it to the edge of Westmar before it was too dark to venture further. I hope there is no Spellstorm tonight because there is no shelter here. Tomorrow I will venture south to catch one of the caravans heading to Longwatch. I hope they don’t question what I carry because I fear I may expose my own heresy.

I am already questioning my decision to take the gauntlet with me but there is so much I can learn from it. I hope the rest of the trip to Longwatch is boring, I could use the time to think.
