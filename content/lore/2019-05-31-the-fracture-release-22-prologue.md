# Excerpts from the Journal of Garrick, Enlightened Vowkeeper

## Book 4 - Page 38

"We were too late. The Fracture happened just before dawn. The corruption of Gyle has been unleashed. The earth shakes as the world hollows. The feral elements are draining from the land and into the Spellstorm. What has she done?"

## Book 4 - Page 42

The damage is worse than I imagined. The bridges leading north from Fort Halcyon are now shattered, even the bridge at Halcyon Pass. The quakes continue, only furthering the destruction. No messages have reached us from Banehelm Keep and it is only rumored that Longwatch may be unscathed. Word from across the land seems to only get worse with each new report.

The Spellstorm surged last night and took with it the Vowguard unit I dispatched to recover the Vowkeeper stores from Lux Vault. Seeing the storm rise I had assumed the worst. To my surprise, a single survivor did return this morning. She seemed different, but the captain of the guard dismissed her so quickly I did not have time to study her for myself. I told the other Vowkeepers to be mindful if they hear of her and report back to me.

Our job now is to serve the people and contain the heresy that caused this disaster. I knew this day could come and I was unprepared. I cannot let that happen again.
