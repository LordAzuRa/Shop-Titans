# Excerpts from the Journal of Garrick, Enlightened Vowkeeper

## Book 2 - Page 468

Today is my fourth day in Dawnholm and I now wish I was staying much longer. The sunrise over the Brimbriar mountains was magnificent. I have not felt this alive in many years. Even in the depths of my research into this fascinating place, I can barely pull my mind away from thoughts of her.

I must focus…on my work.

In the histories of Dawnholm, there are mentions of a vault locked deep within the central keep. The doors have been sealed for ages. Curiously, when I asked Keeper Harmon, he became quite defensive. I get the sense he does not want me here; he has made it clear it is not his job to help in my task.

The keep itself has long been used as a school and training facility. Many Keepers come here for instruction and guidance. The lower floors contain numerous vaults and libraries full of a vast array of artifacts. I am surprised that so few of them have been properly cataloged, but that is why Hope asked for help.

While most people love to dig through jewels and treasures, I am most interested in scrolls and tomes. There were many in the first vaults I explored, but now that we're entering the older stashes, I have seen very few. It almost feels as if they were taken elsewhere, but I know the vaults have remained untouched for centuries. I did find one torn page within an old chest that read "Truths of Gyle". I have seen that name in only one other book and was certain it would not be written anywhere else.

The devastation of Dawnholm is unspeakable. Where there was once old roads, the world itself is torn asunder. The grounds I once strolled through are now fields of ash. On the road to Longwatch I knew I would see many terrible things, but nothing prepared me for that.

My knowledge of how this disaster unfolded is limited. I was unable to venture too close, but the destruction appears magnified towards the center of the keep. I knew that place well. It is nearly unrecognizable now, mostly just splinters. There are shards of stone puncturing the grounds, giving the ruins a vengeful aura I did not expect.

My memories of Dawnholm will now live only within the pages of this journal. I feared for the worst, but I believed along the road I would get word from Hope. No word has come. Seeing the ruins of Dawnholm for myself, I am more crestfallen than ever. If only we could have shared one more sunrise.

A group of Breakers returned from Dawnholm. I knew this day would come. During the chaos, I attempted to push her out of my mind and focus only on the people and the vow. It was a futile attempt to protect a shred of the past.

My fears were confirmed. I heard the tale from a young boy that the Breakers found shelter within a vault. Hope had led him and several others there to protect them from the Spellstorm. She did this again and again sacrificing herself to look for other students. They found her not long after the second night of storms. Her eyes were hollow. He gave me a ring that she had left to him with instructions to find me. I have never seen her wear it. Someday I will research this ring, but not today.

The Breaker that brought the boy to me also carried a strange sash. I have seen several Breakers with these strips of cloth tucked away, mostly out of sight. I realized they are covered in markings, almost like a record of feats completed in the Hollow Lands. It is risky to carry something so obvious—but the Breakers are an open secret. I will see if I can get my hands on one of these sashes to better understand what the Breakers are doing in the Hollow Lands.

I am growing less uncomfortable with the Breakers. I know the choice they made and what that choice is likely doing to them. My curiosity is growing dangerous again, but I cannot help myself.

A long walk will serve me well.
