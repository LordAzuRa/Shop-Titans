# Excerpts from the Journal of Garrick, Enlightened Vowkeeper

## Book 2 - Page 144

Lowland! It pains me to even write it out. My first solo apprenticeship and he sends me to count delinquent children enrolling in the Vowguard. Of all the places in the Highlands this is certainly the worst. I would rather go to Mossburn and be forced to live in the stinking marsh during the rainy season!



I was so mad I took the long way back to my room to think. Over and over I considered all the possible ways I could appeal the decision. Anything that I could use to get a better placement. After spending the rest of the afternoon storming about, I returned to my room.



Unfortunately I have no choice. I am scheduled to leave tomorrow midday so I must pack and be quick. The assignment will last through the fall and I want to make the most of it.



I was given a package that contains details of my commission. The instructions read to meet the Master Instructor and her apprentice in management of recruit training. There is also a map of Lowland Outpost and it is larger than I expected from the other history books I had read. I still need to find a way to pack all the books I hope to read while there.

The road is not long between Fort Halcyon and the southern gates of Lowland Outpost. As the ridge wall rose into view I felt my heart beat quicker. This may not be the opportunity I most desired but I am committed to making the best of it.



The trip had taken most of the day. In the light of the setting sun I was able to get a good view of the surrounding area. I had read descriptions of Lowland Outpost before and had the map, but I was still surprised by the structured layout. It felt specific and ordered, with rows of garrison housing neatly aligned with training fields. This was one of the first areas of the Highlands I had visited that felt laid out purposefully.



It was late by the time we passed through to the center of the outpost. The Master Instructor was not present as I pried my belongings from the wagon. Our escorts informed me that she was on a training patrol and would meet with me in the morning. They offered me some dinner but I was too nervous and tired to eat.



The encampment itself was still buzzing with people. There seems to be little here that is not built to be functional. That stands in strong contrast to my time in Fort Halcyon where there is much beauty and care for form. I am starting to understand that this assignment will give me valuable perspective on aspects of the Highlands I have been previously unaware of.

I awoke before sunrise to knocking on my door. The bangs were not overly aggressive but instead sharp, precise and remarkably impatient. Based on the sounds I was expecting an overly virtuous young recruit was sent to fetch me. Instead I was greeted by a hard looking older woman with deep lines on her face and eyes that held both wisdom and a dose of skepticism.



The woman introduced herself with the standard two arm salute of Vowguard. Her name was Nila Qay and she was the Master Instructor for Lowland Outpost. She made a point to explain that I had overslept and that my assignment started at that moment.



I did not realize my assignment included physical training.



I joined Nila on a training patrol with several other recruits. She spoke very little and I was thankful for that. I struggled to keep up, so the thought of holding conversation did not seem promising.



The march brought us into Fever Ridge. I had read little about this area in the past but from what I remembered, most civilized people had little reason to travel there as there are barely a few small settlements. The only fact I knew was that Ghoul Grass grew there and that it was used as an herb in many medicines.



As a child I had to ingest Ghoul Grass twice. I remember both incidents vividly because of the herbâ€™s vile taste and smell.



Our path did not bring us through the Ghoul Grass fields but I did see a spare group of dilapidated houses spread between a few hills. This was just on the edge of Northmarch Pass, the trade road that leads into the mountains. We stopped for a time while Nila and a few others scouted the area. The houses seemed deserted to me but I had heard this area was once used by drifters and outcasts for any number of unsavory things.



Not long after we stopped, Nila returned and we continued on. I was thankful for the break. Upon returning to the outpost we had breakfast and I started my formal apprenticeship.

My free hours I have split between the field library and studying Nila Qay. Nila is fascinating. She is an incredibly strict instructor but also smart and wise. She is not a Vowkeeper and seems somewhat annoyed that she was assigned another apprentice.



While she has not been forthcoming with much it seems clear she does not trust the Vowkeepers. She resents that they are involved with the Vowguard at all. I am surprised to see that even in the higher ranks of the guard very few interact with Nila at all. They seem to avoid her whenever possible.



I sense Nila knows things. I can only imagine what a lifetime in the guard exposes a person to. While there has not been a major war or conflict in my lifetime I know Nila has been around much longer.

I have always wanted to know more about Ora Fernfall. Ora created the Vowguard generations ago. She was an honored Vowkeeper who was also an extraordinary strategist and warrior. Many of the texts speak of the impressive glory she brought to the Vowkeepers by conceiving and enforcing the Vow Mandate.



A copy of this order exists in the field library here. It reads as a doctrine proclaiming the risks of the use of magic of all sorts and calls for total abstinence. It also greatly restricts the trade of all magic artifacts and regulates the travel of all non-humans through the Highlands.



The mandate itself is credited with bringing prosperity and stability to the Highlands and securing the moral future of us all. All the teachings we have received so far do not point to why this mandate was proclaimed. In all my readings there is not much I can find about what happened before this time. There is also very little information on the history of magic artifacts or studies on how they work.



I have heard there are some accounts that discuss life in the Highlands before the mandate came to pass. From my time in Fort Halcyon I am convinced that none exist in the Vowkeeper library. I was hoping to find some here in the field library. Some old maps I found show that Lowland Outpost was established before the Vow Mandate came to pass. Who used this base? Did they resist when the Vowguard took it over?



I have never understood why the Vowkeepers would restrict any knowledge. Our purpose is to instruct and educate so that history will not repeat itself.

I awoke this morning to find a book on my nightstand. This book contains notes from the field from a Storm Guard unit. These notes are old, from before the Vow Mandate. I skipped breakfast to read as much as I could. There are actual entries from the founding of the Vowguard!



From what I can discern the Vowguard was once called the Storm Guard and their role was to protect and run the Aegis Spires. The text is not clear on why the Aegis Spires needed protection in those days. There are hints of past conflicts but this book contains no specifics. It speaks of a recall order that was given just before the Vow Mandate and only contains a handful of entries following it.



Before the final entry I found a note. It appears to be Nila's handwriting. All it gives is a date and a location to return the book. She must know that I am curious about history and have many questions of my own. I must be very cautious with any of this knowledge. Why does she want this kept a secret? Who should this be kept secret from?



I actually look forward to the patrol tomorrow just for more time to think.
